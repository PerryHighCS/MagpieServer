# MagpieServer
An http version of the AP Magpie Chatbot with a backend Java server and an HTML frontend.

The Magpie Server will be created by extending a simple Http server that is designed to
serve static files from a public folder. The user can access the server and it will 
automatically serve an index.html file if there is one in the public folder.

With a mixture of JavaScript code on the frontend and a new REST endpoint on the server,
this project provides an exploration of client/server architecture.

## Explore:
* Look through the java files and the public folder to see what files we will be
  starting with.
